            <h1 class="heading-text">About Me</h1>
            <p>My Name is Kyal and i am 20 years old from Oldham in grater Manchester. My interest include computers, e-sports, football, American football and F1.
            </p>
            A few years i go into PC gaming and build my own custom PC, this is when i decide that i wanted to pursue a career in the computer industry.
            <p>When i realised that one of my favourite games Counter Strike Global Offensive had a e-sports scene I started to follow it and I now have my favourite teams; Envyus, G2, Cloud 9 and Astralis. E-sports have become like all other sports for
                me in the way that I watch the games every week and support my favourite team.</p>
            <p>The three best spectator sports in my opinion are F1, American football and Football. My favourite drivers are Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen with my favourite team being Mercedes ever since Michael Schumacher drove for them in 2010. Manchester
                united is my favourite football team as i was brought up supporting them. I started to watch American football because of a friend I met in college and we decide to each pick a team that was in the play offs for the super bowl and I choose
                the Seahawks who then went on to win the super bowl and I have followed them ever since.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
